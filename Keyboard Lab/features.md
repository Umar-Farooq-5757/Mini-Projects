### The Core Typing Engine

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Real-Time WPM & Accuracy** | Display Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage update dynamically as the user types, not just at the end. |
| **Raw vs. Adjusted WPM** | Show both **Raw WPM** (speed without error penalties) and **Net WPM** (speed adjusted for errors). |
| **Instant Error Highlighting** | Visually distinguish between correct (green/grey) and incorrect (red) characters immediately. |
| **Backspace Behavior Options** | Allow users to choose if they **must** correct errors (Stop on Error) or if they can keep typing (ignore errors). |
| **Multiple Test Durations** | Standard presets (15s, 30s, 60s) and custom durations (e.g., 5 minutes for endurance). |
| **Word Count Mode** | Tests based on a fixed word count (e.g., "Type these 50 words") rather than a timer. |
| **Smart Restart (Quick Reset)** | A hotkey (usually Tab or Esc) to instantly restart the test if the user fumbles the first word. |
| **Caret Customization** | Options for the cursor style (line, block, underline) and animation (smooth, blinking, solid). |

### Content & Modes

* **Punctuation & Numbers Mode:** Toggle special characters and numbers on/off for advanced difficulty.
* **Quote Mode:** Fetch famous quotes from an API so users are typing meaningful sentences rather than random words.
* **Programming Syntax Mode:** A mode specifically for developers to practice typing code snippets (Python, Java, C++, etc.).
* **Blind Mode:** Hide the text as it is typed (or hide errors) to force users to trust their muscle memory.
* **Sudden Death Mode:** The test ends immediately upon making a single mistake.
* **Zen Mode:** A UI-free experience that removes all timers and stats until the very end to reduce anxiety.

### Deep Analytics & Statistics

* **WPM History Graph:** A line chart showing speed progression over days, weeks, or months.
* **Key Heatmap:** Visual representation of the keyboard showing which keys the user misses most often.
* **Consistency Tracker:** A graph showing the variance in typing speed during a single test (e.g., did they slow down in the middle?).
* **Error Analysis Breakdown:** Detailed list of specific characters frequently swapped (e.g., "You often type 'o' instead of 'p'").
* **Percentile Ranking:** Compare the user's score against the global database (e.g., "Top 5%").

### User Progression & Gamification

* **XP and Leveling System:** Users earn XP for every test completed, unlocking levels or cosmetic titles.
* **Daily Streaks:** Track consecutive days of practice to encourage habit building.
* **Badge/Achievement System:** Awards for milestones (e.g., "Speed Demon" for hitting 100 WPM, "Marathoner" for typing 1 hour total).
* **Global Leaderboards:** Daily, Weekly, and All-Time high score tables.
* **Personal Bests:** Prominent display of the user's highest WPM and Accuracy ever recorded.

### Customization (The "Feel")

* **Theming System:** Dark mode, Light mode, and wildly colorful custom themes (Cyberpunk, Pastel, Terminal).
* **Font Selection:** Allow users to switch between Monospace fonts (Roboto Mono, Fira Code, Courier).
* **Sound Effects:** Mechanical keyboard sounds (Blue, Brown, Red switches) or typewriter sounds on every keypress.
* **Layout Support:** Support for QWERTY, DVORAK, COLEMAK, and WORKMAN layouts.

### Account & Cloud

* **Cloud Sync:** Save stats and settings across devices (Mobile/Desktop) via login.
* **Social Sharing:** One-click generation of a sharable image card ("I just typed 95 WPM!") for Twitter/LinkedIn.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Typing tests available in Spanish, French, German, Russian, etc.

1.  **Multiplayer Racing:** A "Typeracer" style lobby where users can race against friends or randoms in real-time.
2.  **Ghost Replay:** Users can race against a "ghost" of their own previous personal best.
3.  **Resume/Certificate Generation:** Generate a PDF certificate of speed that users can attach to a CV.
4.  **Custom Text Upload:** Allow users to paste their own text (e.g., a book chapter or an article) to practice typing.
5.  **Offline PWA Support:** Make the app a Progressive Web App so it works fully without an internet connection.
6.  **Rhythm Game Mode:** Typing to the beat of a song (integration with Spotify or uploaded tracks).
7.  **Smart Practice Generator:** An algorithm that generates a custom practice text composed only of the words/keys the user usually fails.
8.  **Physical Keyboard Layout Overlay:** An on-screen visual of hands showing which finger should press which key (great for beginners learning touch typing).
9.  **Voice Dictation Practice:** The app speaks a word, and the user must type it (audio-to-text practice).
10. **Typing "Stamina" Test:** An infinite runner mode where the text never stops, testing how long a user can maintain a specific speed before failing.
